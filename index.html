    		<section class="post">
    			<p>I think I know how Breaking Bad will end. Well, at least I think I know how Walt will die and why he needs the big machine gun in his trunk.</p>
    			<p>Walt will die from the ricin that keeps appearing throughout the series. Yes, his own concotion that has played a central role in many scenes over the past few seasons. It's pretty clear the ricin will be used, we just aren't sure how at this point. I can't think of a better use than for the man himself.</p>
    			<p id="suicide">So how will Walt die from the Ricin? I believe he will commit suicide with it...</p>
    			<p>At some point over the final seven episodes, Jesse is going to find himself in danger. This will most likely happen from Lydia trying to get him back into producing the meth. When Walt discovers this development, he'll go in to save him, machine gun blazing. Once Walt is successful in saving Jesse, Walt will realize that the only way to prevent more harm to Jesse and his own family is through his own death.</p>
    			<p>Walt will take his own life with the ricin. <span id="king">Long live the king.</span></p>
